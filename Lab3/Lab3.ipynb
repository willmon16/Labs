    "## Introduction\n",
    "So far our work in computational physics has focused on calculating exact results using known formulas.  In class, we have just begun to discussion how numerical error can affect the outcome of the calculations of those exact results, particularly those due to rounding errors.  In Ch 5 we will discuss the __Algorithmic Errors__ that result when a programmer modifies a theoretical calculation so it may be solved with computational techniques.  We are going to start that process today with a familar problem, radioactive decay.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned in Workshop Physics, if we had a large sample of radioactive nuclei (an especially nasty example is $^{235}U$), the number of nuclei at any given time is governed by a first order differential equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dN}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N(t)$ describes the number of nuclei in the sample as a function of time, $t$, and $\\lambda$ parameterizes the rate at which the nuclei decay.\n",
    "Using the technique of separation of variables, this equation can be solved to yield:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(t) = N_0 e^{- \\lambda t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $N_0$ is the number of nuclei at $t=0$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Numerical Solutions of First Order Differential Equations\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Any function may be expanded as a Taylor series.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }{\\frac {f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}}\\,(x-a)^{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f^{(n)}$ is the $n$-th derivative of the function $f(x)$.  More concretely the sum is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = f(a)+{\\frac {f'(a)}{1!}}(x-a)+{\\frac {f''(a)}{2!}}(x-a)^{2}+{\\frac {f'''(a)}{3!}}(x-a)^{3}+\\cdots .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in each equation above, this is an infinite sum over all terms.  A common technique in physics is to truncate this series after a finite number of terms.  Indeed, most physics students first encounter this when studying the pendulum, during which we make the small angle approximation: $\\sin{\\theta}\\approx\\theta$.  This is a one-term Taylor series expansion of the $sine$ function.  Here is the $sine$ function expanded to 3 terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sin \\left(x\\right)\\approx x-{\\frac {x^{3}}{3!}}+{\\frac {x^{5}}{5!}}-{\\frac {x^{7}}{7!}}.\\!\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational physics we can apply a Taylor expansion to solve differential equations.  This has two advantages, it is very computationally efficient, and it is possible to calculate numerical solutions of differential equations that have no analytic solution.  Since any function may undergo a Taylor expansion, let us expand a function named $N(t)$ - which so far we have not connected to our radioactive decay example .\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(t) = N(t_0) + \\frac{dN}{dt}\\big |_{t=t_0} (t-t_0) + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2 N}{dt^2}\\big |_{t=t_0} (t-t_0)^2 + \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Depending on the desired precision of our calculation, we may keep as many terms as we wish of the Taylor series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If you wish to write the numerical solution as: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(t) \\approx N(t_0) + \\frac{dN}{dt}\\big |_{t=t_0} (t-t_0) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "#### What quantity (t, t$_0$, dN, etc) must be small so that the higher order terms are zero?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta t = t-t_0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This same result may be calculated from an approximation using the definition of the derivative, as Newman does at the end of Ch 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an approximate result (thus the $\\approx$) and we must consider carefully how to minimize the numerical error.  Since we wrote our numerical solution as one that holds while $\\delta t$ is small, we must stick with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know the functional form of the derivative $ \\frac{dN}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t) $, we can insert that into our numerical equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N(t) \\approx N(t_0) + (-\\lambda N(t))\\big |_{t=t_0} (t-t_0) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very useful!  It is what is called a map (which is NOT a continuous function) that discretizes the solution of the number of nuclei into a series of steps, separated by a time $\\delta t$.  Assuming we know the number of nuclei at a given time $N(t_0)$, we can use it to estimate $N$ at some later time $t_1$, assuming $t_1-t_0$ is sufficiently small.  Can you see where this is going?  Using our new number of nuclei at $t_1$, we can calculate the number at some later time $t_2 = t_1+\\delta t$.  If we continue on in this fashion, we can iterate to a solution for the number of nuclei at any arbitry multiple of $\\delta t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is known as the *Euler* method, and I use it in my own research to study the dynamics of interacting particles.  It is not the only algorithm for solving differential equations numerically, but it is an excellent place to start.  We can also examine the numerical errors by comparing them to the exact analytic solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's simplify that function: \n",
    "$$\n",
