    "## Introduction\n",
    "So far our work in computational physics has focused on calculating exact results using known formulas.  In class, we have just begun to discussion how numerical error can affect the outcome of the calculations of those exact results, particularly those due to rounding errors.  In Ch 5 we will discuss the __Algorithmic Errors__ that result when a programmer modifies a theoretical calculation so it may be solved with computational techniques.  We are going to start that process today with a familar problem, radioactive decay.  \n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N(t)$ describes the number of nuclei in the sample as a function of time, $t$, and $\\lambda$ parameterizes the rate at which the nuclei decay.\n",

    "N(t) = N_0 e^{- \\lambda t}\n",

    "Where $N_0$ is the number of nuclei at $t=0$s.  In lab we will also solve this equation numerically and compare our solution to the exact results."

It is what is called a map (which is NOT a continuous function) that discretizes the solution of the number of nuclei into a series of steps, separated by a time $\\Delta t$.  Assuming we know the number of nuclei at a given time $N(t_0)$, we can use it to estimate $N$ at some later time $t_1$, assuming $t_1-t_0$ is sufficiently small.  Can you see where this is going?  Using our new number of nuclei at $t_1$, we can calculate the number at some later time $t_2 = t_1+\\delta t$.  If we continue on in this fashion, we can iterate to a solution for the number of nuclei at any arbitry multiple of $\\delta t$.\n",
