    "* Clone/download the repository to your own directory\n",
    "* Make a new branch, call it Version-0, this is where you will do your work - I am just learning how important this is!!!\n",
    "* Save your work to the local machine regularly.\n",
    "* Commit your work on this branch to GitHub regularly - you don't have to wait until the end of class.\n",

    "Do your work in this file, so it is easy for me to find/grade.  However, there are good reasons to use multiple files in traditional coding projects, so if you have a good reason to want to make a new file, please talk to me about how to make that work.\n",

    "#### Version-0: \n",
    "Before you leave lab today, commit your changes to GitHub, and open a pull request, comparing your forked Version-0 branch back to my original repository.  That's all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version-1: \n",
    "By Monday 9:15am, clean up any unfinished details.  \n",
    "   * Every code should be well documented with comments.\n",
    "   * Every graph should be well labeled.  If there is more than one data set or curve, add a legend.\n",
    "   * Describe each graph with a short paragraph.  What is data plotted, why is it interesting, what model fits that data, is this the model you expect?  Give a written scientific description in complete sentences.\n",
    "   * Open a pull request on GitHub comparing your forked Version-1 branch back to my original repository.\n",

    "   * Compare our solutions, and look for places you could improve your work \n",
