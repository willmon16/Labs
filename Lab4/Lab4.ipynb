    "### Grading: \n",
    "We will be doing the cyclic grading cycle for this assignment.  See the complete syllabus - posted on Moodle - some detailed notes on grading and correcting your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do your work in this file, so it is easy for me to find/grade.  However, there are good reasons to use multiple files in traditional coding projects, so if you have a good reason to want to make a new file, please talk to me about how to make that work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version-0: \n",
    "Switch back to the Version-0 branch in labs to do this work.  Before you leave lab today, commit your changes to GitHub, and open a pull request, comparing your forked Version-0 branch back to my original repository.  That's all.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version-1: \n",
    "By Monday 5:00pm, clean up any unfinished details.  \n",
    "   * Every code should be well documented with comments.\n",
    "   * __Every function should have a docstring.__\n",
    "   * Every graph should be well labeled.  If there is more than one data set or curve, add a legend.\n",
    "   * Describe each graph with a short paragraph.  What is data plotted, why is it interesting, what model fits that data, is this the model you expect?  Give a written scientific description in complete sentences.  Feel free to modify these prompts to suit the particular graph.\n",
    "   * Open a pull request on GitHub comparing your forked Version-1 branch back to my original repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version-2*: \n",
    "After class on Monday, I will post my solution.  \n",
    "   * Compare our solutions, and look for places you could improve your work \n",
    "     * Are your calculations correct?\n",
    "     * Did you understand (and describe) the physics correctly? \n",
    "     * Did you forget anything?\n",
    "   * Make improvements and comments about your changes.  \n",

    "  the approximate distance traveled by the particle in the $x$ direction as\n",

    "This problem is funny - you can't use your algorithm for calculating the trapezoid method for a function, you have to do something quite different here - calculate the area of each trapezoid given both its legs.  You also need to store each step in an array, so you can plot the displacement as a function of time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend you grab a whiteboard and work this out ahead of coding it.\n",

    "Be sure to:\n",
    "1.  Make separate plots for $x$ vs. $t$ and the $v$ vs. $t$ so you can see the details on $v$.\n",
    "2.  Add labels to your plots - as many as needed to clearly convey the physics.\n",
    "3.  Describe your plots physically - be sure to explain the relationship between the $x$ vs. $t$ to the $v$ vs. $t$, so it is clear the numerical integration is a good model for the given velocity data."
